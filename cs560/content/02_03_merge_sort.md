# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, **recursively** sorts the two halves, and then merges the sorted halves.

## Takeaway

- Textbook Figure 2.4 (a merge sort example)
- understand the merge sort algorithm and its implementation.
- use merge sort as an example, understand the **Divide-and-Conquer** strategy. Also practice divide-and-conquer for binary search and (optional) Quick sort.

## Divide-and-Conquer(-and-Combine)

Divide-and-conquer is a problem-solving strategy that breaks a problem into **smaller, simpler subproblems**, solves the subproblems, and then combines the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.

### Divide

Divide the problem into **smaller** subproblems that are similar to the original problem.

### Conquer

Conquer the subproblems by solving them **recursively**. If the subproblem is small enough, solve it directly.

### Combine

Combine the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.

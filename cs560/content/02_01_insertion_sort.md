# Insertion Sort

{description of insertion sort}

Takeaway:

- understand the insertion sort algorithm and its implementation.
- use insertion sort as an example, understand the loop invariant. Also practice loop invariant for bubble sort and (optional) selection sort.

## Insertion Sort Practice Questions

1. implement the insertion sort algorithm in a programming language of your choice.
1. describe insertion sort algorithm in your own wordds, and comment each step.
1. why insertion sort "ignores" the first element?
1. describe the two loop indices in insertion sort.
1. What is the loop invariant for insertion sort?

## Loop Invariant

A loop invariant is a statement that is true before and after each iteration of a loop. It is a way to reason about the correctness of an algorithm.

In other words, a loop invariant is a statement that holds for three things: initialization, maintenance, and termination. The statement usually involves the loop variable and the data structure being manipulated.
